After reading the GitHub Basics Tutorial I learned some valuable things ahout how to use this interface. For example,

1. A repository is where the project work happens
2.  Branches and forks are for when you don't want certain things added to the main project quite yet
3. Pull Requests announce changes to collaborators where discussion and reviews can happen. 


I hope to be able to use all of these features efficiently soon!
